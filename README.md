# odin-recipes
Odin Recipes is a website that list 3 of my favorite recipes.

I learned how to setup an html file with attributes. I also learned how to link multiple webpages using relative paths.
I know how to add lists using ordered and unordered list elements, and how to add images and links.
Finally, I'm starting to understand how to use git to commit.
