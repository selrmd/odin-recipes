        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cubed</li>
            <li>1 cup sliced carrots</li>
            <li>1 cup frozen green peas</li>
            <li>1/2 cup sliced celery</li>
            <li>1/3 cup butter</li>
            <li>1/3 cup chopped onion</li>
            <li>1/3 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/3 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon celery seed</li>
            <li>1 3/4 cups chicken broth</li>
            <li>2/3 cup milk</li>
            <li>2 (9 inch) unbaked pie crusts</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Combine chicken, carrots, peas, and celery in a saucepan; add water to cover and bring to a boil. 
                <br/>Boil for 15 minutes, then remove from the heat and drain.</li>
            <li>While the chicken is cooking, melt butter in another saucepan over medium heat. 
                <br/>Add onion and cook until soft and translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in flour, salt, pepper, and celery seed. 
                <br/>Slowly stir in chicken broth and milk. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until thick, 5 to 10 minutes. 
                <br/>Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
            <li>Place chicken and vegetables in the bottom pie crust. Pour hot liquid mixture over top. Cover with top crust, seal the edges, and cut away any excess dough. 
                <br/>Make several small slits in the top crust to allow steam to escape.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until pastry is golden brown and filling is bubbly, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
